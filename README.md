# Visualization of (relatively) clear clustering of MNIST dataset- autoencoder + t-SNE dim-reduction

This script trains an autoencoder to compress the MNIST dataset into a relatively small dimension (30 for the below images), then applies t-SNE dimensionality reduction to compress the dataset further into 2 or 3 dimensions which are visualized below.

Below is the resulting visualization of the MNIST dataset visualized in two dimensions:

![2-dim](imgs/mnist2.png)

![3-dim](imgs/mnist3.png)

It may be hard to see the clustering in a static image, so here is an animated version of the above plot.
